## Description
The coreConfigurator class is a PHP implementation for managing configuration files in a simple JSON-based format. It provides an interface for adding, deleting, getting, and setting configurations in these files.

## Features
  - **Simple configuration management**: The class provides a straightforward way to manage configurations for an application. It uses JSON structured files to store configurations, making it easy to read and write settings using native PHP functions.
  - **Reusability**: The class can be easily integrated into any PHP project that requires configuration management. It's not tied to a specific framework or project structure, so developers can reuse the class across multiple projects.
  - **Modularity**: The class allows developers to organize configurations into separate files, promoting modularity and making it easier to manage application settings. Each file can be dedicated to a specific part of the application, reducing the risk of conflicts between settings.
  - **Flexibility**: The class provides a simple API to add, get, set and delete configurations. Developers can extend or modify the class to add more advanced features or adapt it to their specific needs.
