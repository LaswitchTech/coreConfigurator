## Set Configuration Value
To set a value in a configuration file, use the `setRouterAction()` method by adding `'action': 'configurator/set'` in your route. This method takes three $_GET parameters: the configuration file, the configuration key, and the configuration value. The method returns a boolean value indicating whether the configuration value was set successfully.
